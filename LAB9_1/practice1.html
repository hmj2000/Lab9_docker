    <!-- Introduction of myself -->
    I am a student at The University of Kansas, completing my Bachelors of Computer Science (BCS) with a minor in Business from The University of Kansas School of Business. <br><br>
    
    I've taken numerous courses that have given me the confidence to work on my skills that allow me to potentially create tools and resources to help others. I'm looking forward to creating and working on future projects, but at this time my time is split between school, work, and side businesses. <br><br>

    Not only that, but I am really passionate about all things financial and investing. Furthermore, I have a huge interest in learning about ways I can leverage my money and assets to help them grow, and I plan on owning different assets that help me reach my goals of F.I.R.E (Financial Independence Retire Early). Watch the video below to learn more about F.I.R.E and check out my temporary website to my business below. <br><br>
